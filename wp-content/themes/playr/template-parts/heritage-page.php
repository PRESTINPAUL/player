            <p class="HeritagePost-description u-desktopOnly">Scientific innovation is often met with resistance: Albert Einstein was disrespected by fellow physicists, Galileo Galilei’s work went against religious convention while Isaac Newton was regarded as a deviant for his philosophical views. Like science, football is slow to accept new ideas which makes the immediate success sports scientist Chris Barnes enjoyed when asked to create ‘what was the first multidisciplinary sports science department for an English Premier League club’ at Middlesbrough F.C in 1997 all the more impressive.</p>

Often a day lost in the fanfare of a month containing Valentine’s Day, and perhaps more importantly, the return of the Champions League knockout stages, many overlook the significance of the Premier League’s anniversary and why it should be a date circled in bright red marker.</p>
